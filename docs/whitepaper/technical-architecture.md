# Technical Architecture

## System Overview

MEMEFANS is built on a robust technical foundation that ensures high performance, security, and scalability. Our architecture leverages Solana's high-speed blockchain and integrates seamlessly with PUMP DEX for efficient token operations.

## Core Components

### PUMP DEX Integration
```typescript
interface PumpIntegration {
    swapEngine: {
        purchaseTokens(): Promise<boolean>;
        checkLiquidity(): number;
        optimizeGas(): void;
    };
    priceOracle: {
        getCurrentPrice(): number;
        getPriceHistory(): PriceData[];
    };
}
```

### Distribution Engine
- Automated token distribution
- Real-time transaction processing
- Smart contract optimization
- Gas fee minimization

### Security Layer
